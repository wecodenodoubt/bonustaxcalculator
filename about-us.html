<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>Bonus Tax Calculator is a free online tool designed to help users understand why their bonus payments are taxed higher than expected.</p>

<p>Our mission is to simplify complex financial topics and provide quick, easy-to-understand estimates for users in the USA, UK, and Canada.</p>

<p>We are not a financial institution or tax advisory firm. Our tools provide estimated calculations for educational purposes only.</p>

<p>We believe financial clarity should be accessible to everyone.</p>
